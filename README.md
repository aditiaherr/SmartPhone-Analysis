1. INTRODUCTION
   
2.Problem Statement:

The rapid evolution of the mobile phone industry has resulted in the emergence of numerous models, each with unique features, specifications, and price points. Mobile shop owners often face challenges in keeping up with the latest models and providing accurate recommendations to customers. The project aims to develop a machine learning model, using the Random Forest algorithm in Python, to predict smartphone prices for a retailerâ€™s website. This website will allow retailers to estimate smartphone prices and includes a dashboard for visualizing the relationships between various smartphone features and their impact on price.

3.Project Idea:

The project focuses on building a prediction model that forecasts the price of a smartphone using technical specifications such as RAM, ROM, camera resolution, battery power, and brand. The website allows users to input smartphone features and retrieve an estimated price. The integrated dashboard provides comparative insights using graphical representations of the dataset, helping retailers make informed decisions regarding product pricing and inventory.

4.Motivation:

The smartphone market is highly competitive, with various models featuring different configurations and price points. Accurately predicting smartphone prices based on their specifications can help retailers price their products competitively, and assist customers in comparing options efficiently. This project serves both consumers and retailers by offering accurate price predictions and detailed attribute comparisons.

5.Scope:

This project is designed for use by smartphone retailers, enabling them to predict the price of new or existing smartphone models based on their technical specifications. The system also provides a visual dashboard to compare different smartphone features like battery capacity, camera quality, and RAM, giving retailers better control over inventory pricing. The predictive model and dashboard can be further expanded to include additional features or attributes and can be applied to other product categories.
